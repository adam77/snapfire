HOW TO MAKE A LIST:

Run Local Version...
1. Unzip attached file to a directory.
2. Open index.html in browser (Firefox only).
3. Navigate to a list and check it works normally.

Create New File...
1. Copy a file in the 'lists' directory (e.g. SM_codex.json) to a new
file (e.g. SM_mylist_NETEA.json).
2. Navigate to a list in the browser, and change the last part of the
URL to point at the new file (e.g. list=SM_mylist_NETEA) and press
return.
3. The list should load as before.

Edit New File...
1. Get hold of a text editor (notepad++ is good and a free download).
2. Open new list file in text editor.
3. Change name of list to something new; check it works in browser.
4. Finish making changes. Start with formations, then upgrades, then
constraints (be careful to always match up quotation marks; and that
there are no trailing commas in lists).
