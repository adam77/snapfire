% ARMY LIST

\section{Death Guard Army}
\subsection{Using the Army List}
Death Guard Marines are organised around core formations
called companies or retinues of Plague Marines which are
supported by rarer formations of specialised troops.

Some formations are Core Retinues – these are the backbone
of the Death Guard army. More rare and specialised
formations are Support Retinues and you may not have more
Support Formations than Death Guard Retinue formations.
The chart below shows the name of the formation, what units
comprise it, what upgrades are allowed for it, and the points
cost for the formation.

Each upgrade that is taken adds to the cost of the formation,
as shown on the upgrade chart. The upgrade chart also lists
the units that make up the upgrade. Note that these will
sometimes replace units in the formations they are taken for,
and sometimes adds additional units to the formation. Each
upgrade may be taken \underline{once} per formation.
\specialRule{Stubborn}{
 Nurgle’s
 followers are inured against pain, implacable
 and diseased of mind in many cases. The Death Guard
 always had a reputation for tenacity, which has not been
 reduced by their exposure to the Warp. \par
 All units that are Stubborn may make their normal armour
 saves (including any re-rolls that may apply) against
 hackdown hits due to losing close combat or hits caused
 by suffering Blast Markers when broken. Note that
 Stubborn units are still destroyed outright if they are
 within 15cm of enemy at the end of a Withdrawal move.
