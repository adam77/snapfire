	Nurgle empowers those who would see every accomplishment of Mankind reduced to mouldering ruin.
	He is the Lord of Decay, and his servants spread disease and contagion throughout the moral realm in the name of their festering master.
	Nurgle’s appearance is the most abhorrent of the Chaos gods. His bloated body is home to every form of corruption imaginable, and his skin is covered in weeping sores.
	Foul Nurglings cavort amongst Nurgle’s exposed organs, giggling with insane delight at the latest pestilence inflicted upon Mankind by their master.
