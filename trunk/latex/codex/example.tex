\codexTitle{Death Guard}{Experimental Army List}{v2.2 by Henrikki Almusa}

\section{The Death Guard}

\subsection{Nurgle}
Nurgle empowers those who would see every accomplishment of Mankind reduced to
mouldering ruin. He is the Lord of Decay, and his servants spread
disease and contagion throughout the moral realm in the name
of their festering master. Nurgle’s appearance is the most abhorrent
of the Chaos gods. His bloated body is home to every form of corruption
imaginable, and his skin is covered in weeping sores. Foul Nurglings
cavort amongst Nurgle’s exposed organs, giggling with insane delight
at the latest pestilence inflicted upon Mankind by their master.

\subsection{Death Guard}
Servants of Nurgle, the Death Guard fight only to spread
contagion and death throughout the galaxy. These once proud
Space Marines have now been reduced to pestilent, disease-
infested killers. The Death Guard consist largely of Plague
Marines: creatures so vile they have given their entire existence
to spreading Nurgle’s Rot amongst the living. Those infected with
the rot meet a painful death, their bodies reduced to a mass of
weeping sores and pestilent weals. Death is no release for these
wretches, who find themselves reborn into the service of Grandfather
Nurgle, to whom their cries for relief from the ever-present plague
are like the clamouring of loving children.

\subsection{The Festering Death}
The Legion of Festering Death, formally known by the Imperium as the
Silver Scythes had been based on the rim of Imperial space when the
Heresy swept the Imperium into civil war. Overlooked by many and far
away from the bulk of the fighting the Legion’s commanders quickly
succumbed to the lure of Chaos and entered the fray, siding with the
Lord of Decay. The Legion set about bringing famine and
pestilence to the world on the rim and unleashed ancient plagues
upon the planets, thus winning their Lord’s favour.

% ARMY LIST

\section{Death Guard Army}
\subsection{Using the Army List}
Death Guard Marines are organised around core formations
called companies or retinues of Plague Marines which are
supported by rarer formations of specialised troops.

Some formations are Core Retinues – these are the backbone
of the Death Guard army. More rare and specialised
formations are Support Retinues and you may not have more
Support Formations than Death Guard Retinue formations.
The chart below shows the name of the formation, what units
comprise it, what upgrades are allowed for it, and the points
cost for the formation.

Each upgrade that is taken adds to the cost of the formation,
as shown on the upgrade chart. The upgrade chart also lists
the units that make up the upgrade. Note that these will
sometimes replace units in the formations they are taken for,
and sometimes adds additional units to the formation. Each
upgrade may be taken \underline{once} per formation.
\specialRule{Stubborn}{
 Nurgle’s
 followers are inured against pain, implacable
 and diseased of mind in many cases. The Death Guard
 always had a reputation for tenacity, which has not been
 reduced by their exposure to the Warp. \par
 All units that are Stubborn may make their normal armour
 saves (including any re-rolls that may apply) against
 hackdown hits due to losing close combat or hits caused
 by suffering Blast Markers when broken. Note that
 Stubborn units are still destroyed outright if they are
 within 15cm of enemy at the end of a Withdrawal move.
